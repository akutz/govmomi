// ResourceEventHandler can handle notifications for events that
// happen to a resource. The events are informational only, so you
// can't return an error.  The handlers MUST NOT modify the objects
// received; this concerns not only the top level of structure but all
// the data structures reachable from it.
//   - OnAdd is called when an object is added.
//   - OnUpdate is called when an object is modified. Note that oldObj is the
//     last known state of the object-- it is possible that several changes
//     were combined together, so you can't use this to see every single
//     change. OnUpdate is also called when a re-list happens, and it will
//     get called even if nothing changed. This is useful for periodically
//     evaluating or syncing something.
//   - OnDelete will get the final state of the item if it is known, otherwise
//     it will get an object of type DeletedFinalStateUnknown. This can
//     happen if the watch is closed and misses the delete event and we don't
//     notice the deletion until the subsequent re-list.
